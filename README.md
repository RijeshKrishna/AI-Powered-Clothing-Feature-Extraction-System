# AI-Powered-Clothing-Feature-Extraction-System
A multimodal AI system that extracts detailed clothing attributes (like color, pattern, sleeve type, occasion, season) from images using vision-language models. Ideal for powering smart fashion tools, virtual stylists, e-commerce tagging, and personalized outfit pipelines.

Overview

This project uses vision-language models (VLMs) and deep learning techniques to automatically extract structured fashion attributes from a single clothing image. It infers high-level features like **occasion**, **sleeve length**, and **season** using both visual cues and LLM-driven reasoning.
